# Calculator
A project meant to emulate a calculator using a combination of javascript, html, and css.

This project essentially replicates a calculator, allowing users to enter numbers and operators to perform various mathematical operations on them using both a keyboard and html buttons. Unlike traditional calculators available on computers, an additional backspace button will be added, allowing users to undo their last input.

As a little side note, while the calculator stores previous results as needed, it does not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time.
